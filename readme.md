## Learnings from the project:

- Basics of Swift and SwiftUI
- Working my way around XCode

    It took me a week just to understand Swift programming language, SwiftUI views and modifiers, and their implimentation to real life projects. I kept re-doing things and finally got it to look perfect by the end of the week.
